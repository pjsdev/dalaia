## The Primordial Soil

Before [[Dalaia]], before [[Trilldais]] and before time itself, there was only a field of formless soil, a vast expanse of potential, unseeded and dry. It hung in nothingness with no edges to discern it from the void. Then came [[Kaelthar]] as a seed to the soil and [[Nythra]] flowing as nourishing water. Once they were joined, he grew upward and became a great tree whose leaves were the boundless heavens while she sank into the soil to become the endless deep. They were opposites in form and nature, yet each was incomplete without the other. [[Kaelthar]] was luminous and restless, ever-reaching outward in his desire to create, while [[Nythra]] was still and silent with restrained potential.

For countless eons they swayed in tumultuous darkness dancing together in their differences. From the eternal energy of their tension, sparks were born, igniting the first stars and scattering light into the darkness. As they continued to move together, their combined essence gave rise to the foundations of existence: light, shadow, chaos, order, creation and destruction.
## The Shaping of Dalaia

[[Kaelthar]], in his exuberance, began to weave the first threads of life. He created the sun to cast light upon the shadows, and two silver thrones for him and [[Nythra]] as moons in the night sky. But his creations were violent and untamed, and for five timeless days they fell back into the primordial soil each time [[Kaelthar]] made them.

On the sixth attempt, [[Nythra]] took pity on [[Kaelthar]] and reified her soil to provide structure to hold [[Kaelthar]]’s visions. She shaped the seas, the mountains and the fertile earth from her depths, nourishing the fragile creations [[Kaelthar]] had envisioned. 

Together, they gave birth to [[Dalaia]], a world of endless potential.

Yet as [[Dalaia]] grew, [[Kaelthar]] and [[Nythra]] found themselves at odds once more. [[Kaelthar]] desired constant creation, an ever-expanding cycle of new wonders. [[Nythra]], however, believed that balance and stillness were essential for beauty to endure. Their arguments shook the very fabric of the world, causing great upheavals—volcanoes erupted, seas churned, and mountains crumbled.
## The Ten

Realising that their conflicting natures threatened to undo all they had built, [[Kaelthar]] and [[Nythra]] retreated to the heavens to reflect. [[Nythra]], with her deep wisdom, proposed a solution: they would create a new generation, ten beings born from their essence, to govern and nurture the world. These children would embody fragments of both their parents’ power and personality, ensuring that no single force could dominate.

[[Kaelthar]] hesitated. “What if they quarrel as we have? What if they undo what we have made?”

[[Nythra]] smiled, her voice as deep and calm as the ocean. “Then they will learn as we have, and the world will grow from their struggles. Chaos and harmony are but threads in the same tapestry, my love. Let them weave it.”

And so, [[Kaelthar]] and [[Nythra]] poured their essence into ten divine seeds, each a blend of their opposing natures. The seeds took root in the heart of [[Dalaia]], growing into the gods who would inherit the world as a republic. 

[[Fellingshea]] – Hearth, Charity, and Community.
[[Sarvino]] – Chaos, Destruction, and Transformation.
[[Pund]] – Balance, Duality, and Cycles.
[[Vethros]] – Secrets, Shadows, and Knowledge.
[[Zareth]] – Law, Order, and Discipline.
[[Delgrun]] – Forge, Craftsmanship, and Innovation.
[[Thallora]] – Agriculture, Fertility, and Renewal.
[[Mirevar]] – Sea, Storms, and Exploration.
[[Kerasis]] – Art, Song, and Passion.
[[Qethra]] – War, Strategy, and Honour.
## The Departure of the Parents

Eons passed and their children began to learn and grow, making their own mistakes, each balancing the influence of their siblings. Though [[Kaelthar]] and [[Nythra]] loved their children and the world they had created, they could hardly resist overshadowing their purpose. Though their children did great wonders, mortals only looked to The Father and Mother. Worse, the parents’ own opposing natures still held the immense power to upset the fragile balance of [[Dalaia]].

With heavy hearts, they called their children together and spoke their final decree:

>“We leave you now, for this world is yours to shape. Tend to it, as we tended to each other. Protect it, but do not smother it. Let mortals grow through struggle and triumph, as you too shall grow. We will be watching from the farthest reaches of the heavens and the deepest folds of the ocean.”

They joined, ascending together to become the stars and take their seats on the moons. Their presence remains felt in every sunrise, every tide, and every storm, but they no longer intervene directly. The Ten divine siblings inherited a world filled with their parents’ contradictions with the task to help it prosper.
## The Legacy of the Parents

Mortals, aware of [[Kaelthar]] and [[Nythra]]’s departure, honour the Father and Mother as distant, untouchable forces. Prayers to them are rare and reserved for the most desperate moments. Instead, mortals turn to the Ten for guidance, as they are seen as more relatable and involved in the daily affairs of the world.

Some legends whisper that [[Kaelthar]] and [[Nythra]] still watch their children from afar, testing their resolve and subtly influencing their actions. Others believe the parents are locked in eternal slumber, dreaming of what their creation might one day become.

Regardless, their departure cemented the balance they sought: a world guided by their children, shaped by their struggles, and brimming with potential.
