The God of balance, duality and cycles. A child of [[Kaelthar]] and [[Nythra]].
## The Scales of Pund

When [[Kaelthar]] and [[Nythra]] departed, [[Pund]] was struck by the enormity of their task. He watched as his siblings carved the world to their liking—[[Fellingshea]] building warmth and community, [[Sarvino]] sowing chaos, [[Zareth]] drafting unyielding laws, and others weaving their domains into the fabric of existence. [[Pund]] worried that their actions would tilt the balance too far in one direction, undoing all that their parents had envisioned.

To ensure the world did not fall into disorder or tyranny, [[Pund]] approached [[Zareth]], the god of laws and civilization, to create a safeguard. Together with [[Delgrun]] they forged the [[Scales of Pund]], an artifact capable of measuring the balance of forces in the world. [[Pund]] placed the Scales in the heavens, where they would weigh the collective deeds of mortals and gods alike. When chaos outweighed order, mortals would face upheaval. When order became oppressive, rebellion would rise.

The Scales are not infallible, however, for mortals’ actions often blur the lines between good and evil, chaos and law. [[Pund]] watches on, intervening only when the balance threatens to collapse entirely. Those who pray to [[Pund]] often find themselves tested—blessed with strength when they act in harmony with the Scales, but weakened when they stray too far toward one extreme.
## Trilldaian Followers

In [[Trilldais]], the followers of [[Pund]] are a holy order focused on doing some good, and some mischief. They take ire with hyperbole and extremes of religious virtue or vice.
